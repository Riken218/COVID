All COVID codes written near beginning of 2020 pandemic

Using data collected by Johns Hopkins (available on GitHub), this is a collection of programs meant to analyze 
trends in the data using very simple models.

Warning: after the first wave, the models no longer accurately reflect the data since they assumed a single pulse.

There are obvious flaws in the code structure that I don't care to fix since I had severe anxiety while writing them
and don't want to go down that road again; 600,000+ deaths in the U.S. alone is way too many for me to handle.

Feel free to remove/comment out the data-fitting sections to just observe the data.
